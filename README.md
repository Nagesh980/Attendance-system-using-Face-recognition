# Attendance-system-using-Face-recognition
This project is an automated attendance system using facial recognition powered by a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning model. It captures live video to recognize and log attendance based on facial features, providing a seamless and accurate method for tracking attendance. The system reduces manual errors, speeds up the process, and ensures security by marking only recognized individuals as present. Built with KNN for reliable facial recognition, itâ€™s suitable for use in schools, workplaces, and events.

Features:
Real-time facial recognition with KNN for accurate attendance marking
Database integration for efficient record storage and retrieval
Admin interface for managing attendance records
Scalable and adaptable to different organizational needs
